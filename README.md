# Hello, I'm Mari!

## UX/UI Designer

I started my carreer as a graphic designer and the most part of my projects was editorial design, but as long as I was evolving as designer, I realized I was more interessed in digital projects, so I started to learn about technology, user interactions and digital solutions. Today I work in a big retail company, where I could create solutions to make the employees easier and better. Now I’m responsible for the e-commerce projct, and I always try to create solutions to do something good to ours customers and to our team.


### 2016 - Current Job: Leroy Merlin - São Paulo - SP

Leroy Merlin is a french company, it’s a house and construction retail company and we have 43 stores in Brazil. I was hired to start the Suppliers Portal Project on the IT Department, to create a solution to solve the problems between the company and suppliers, where they can schedule the products delivery on the stores and warehouses, they can see how much money the company has to pay them, all those features without need a help from the Leroy Merlin team. This project started small and now it’s making profit to the company.
Since 2017 I work at the e-commerce project, on the Marketing Department and I’m responsible for the whole buy flow, delivery types, checkout experience and I’m leading the Design System project, when our team started to grow faster, we felt our style guide wasn’t enough, then I started this project.
